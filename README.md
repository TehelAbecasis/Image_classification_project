# Image classification project:

In this project I built a model for training a neural network which will be able to differentiate between:
- Screenshots of chats (WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Documents
- Handwriting
- Facebook
- Other

The project was created in order to optimize the work in the investigation department of the Competition Authority
